### What I learned

The difference from the previous challenges of Frontend Mentor is the use of background images positioning, it was really hard to figure out the best way to place the background images exactly as the design suggested but when clearly read about how background-position property work the process was really simple.

From this challenge, I understood the easy way to get going without struggle is to keep learning each element of HTML and CSS and how they exactly work.

### Useful resources

- [background-position](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position) - This one article of MDN is enough to know well about all gimmicks of the positioning of images.
